    "    - Start by putting all code in notebooks\n",
    "    - Be prepared to migrate some of the perfunctory code to a module file\n",
    "- Install Python data science libraries for plotting, opening datasets, slicing\n",
    "    - starting with `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `pandas`, and `xarray`\n",
    "- As needed bring in Python extension libraries\n",
    "    - interactive widgets, maps, animation, color maps\n",

    "- I create an account at `github.com` and learn to use the basic `git` commands\n",
    "    - `git pull`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, `git clone`, `git stash`\n",
    "    - I plan to spend a couple of hours learning `git`; I find good YouTube tutorials\n",
    "- I create my own GitHub repository with a `README.md` file describing my research goals\n",

    "    - As I am using a PC I install WSL-2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux v2)...\n",
    "        - ...and install Miniconda plus some Python libraries\n",
    "- I clone my \"empty\" repository from GitHub to my local Linux environment\n",
    "- I start my Jupyter notebook server, navigate to my repo, and create a first notebook\n",
    "- I save my notebook and use `git add, commit, push` to save it safely on GitHub\n",
    "- On GitHub: Add and test a **`binder`** badge\n",
    "    - Once that works, be sure to `git pull` the modified GitHub repo back into the local copy\n",

    "\n",

    "At this point we do not have any data; so let's do that next. There are two important considerations. \n",
    "First: If the data volume will exceed 100MB: That is too much to keep in a GitHub repository. The\n",
    "data must be staged \"nearby\" in the local environment; outside the repository but accessible by\n",
    "the repository code, as in:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Second: Suppose the repo *does* contain (smaller) datasets, to be read by the code. \n",
    "If the intent is to use `binder` to make a sandbox version of the repo\n",
    "available, all significant changes to this code should be tested: First locally\n",

    "built to work with this file format, specifically via the `Dataset` and \n",
    "the `DataArray` structures. These in turn inherit from the `pandas` `DataFrame` and `Series`; which in turn\n",
    "are built on the `numpy` n-dimensional array `ndarray`. All of this requires considerable time to \n",
    "learn and internalize. Some care is taken in this narrative to provide salient remarks for the Learner. \n",
    "In polemical terms I recommend two approaches for the person new to this set of tools: \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- Read through this notebook without too much concern for detail (suited to a focus on \n",
    "    the data, not on learning to build new workflows).\n",
    "- Work methodically through Jake VanDerplas' excellent (free, online) book \n",
    "    [_The Python Data Science Handbook_ (herein abbreviated **PDSH**)](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) \n",
    "    particularly chapters 2 and 3, to gain expertise with `NumPy` and `pandas` prior to taking on `XArray`. \n",

    "### Nitrate \n",

    "    \n",

    "and no wavelength channel. \n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "I kept the pressure bins the same even though the nitrate averates about 3 three samples or less per minute\n",
    "during a 70 minute ascent. That's about three meters per minute so one sample per meter. Since the \n",
    "spectrophotometer bin depth is 0.25 meters there are necessarily a lot of empty bins (bins with no data)\n",
    "for the nitrate profile. \n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Two open issues\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A curious artifact of the situation is from a past bias: I had understood that the SCIP makes pauses \n",
    "on descent to accommodate the nitrate sensor. I may be in error but now it looks like this sensor, \n",
    "the nitrate sensor, is observing on ascent which is continuous. This leaves open the question of \n",
    "why the pauses occur on the descent. If I have that right. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally there are two nitrate signals: 'samp' and 'dark'. This code addresses only 'samp' as 'dark'\n",
    "is showing nothing of interest. So this is an open issue."
