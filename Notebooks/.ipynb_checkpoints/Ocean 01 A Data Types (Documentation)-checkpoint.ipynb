    "* Level 1 ***Instrument deployment***: Unprocessed, parsed data parameter that is in instrument/sensor \n",
    "units and resolution. See note below defining a *deployment*.\n",

    "and to Users. The mechanisms are THREDDS and ERDDAP; file format  \n",

    "\n",
    "### Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **instrument**: A physical device with one or more sensors.\n",
    "- **stream**: Sensor data.\n",
    "- **deployment**: The act of putting infrastructure in the water, or the length of \n",
    "time between a platform going in the water and being recovered and brought back to shore.There are \n",
    "multiple deployment files per instrument. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What these notebooks do\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These notebooks focus on a core set of instruments, specifically those of the cabled array shallow profiler, \n",
    "to demonstrate transformation from data files to ocean science interpretation and analysis. The shallow profilers \n",
    "consist of two separate, related entities: The **profiler** and the **platform**. Both generate data. \n",
    "We take on something of \n",
    "an engineering perspective to set the context for this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shallow profiler overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The deployments run 2015 to present; with intermittent interruptions due to servicing and *force majeure*. \n",
    "There are three shallow profilers:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 500m depth: Outer edge of the continental shelf off of central Oregon\n",
    "2. 3100m depth: Further out at the base of the continental shelf off central Oregon\n",
    "3. 2100m depth: At the Juan de Fuca plate boundary at the base of Axial Seamount\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Platform\n",
    "\n",
    "The shallow profiler **platform** is tethered to\n",
    "the sea floor by means of two long cables. It is positively buoyant and sits 200 meters below \n",
    "the surface. The platform has both power and a data connection back to shore. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Profiler\n",
    "\n",
    "The shallow profiler **profiler** rests in a cradle on the **platform**. \n",
    "It is also positively buoyant. Under normal circumstances\n",
    "this profiler is allowed to rise to near the surface (depth of approximately 10 meters) nine times each day. \n",
    "This is accomplished by means of a single cable on a winch. As the profiler ascends its \"upward facing\"\n",
    "sensors acquire data. Once the profiler reaches the top of the profile it is winched back down again. \n",
    "\n",
    "From notebook **Ocean 01 D** which characterizes profile ascent/descent/rest intervals: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Mean time in minutes for...\n",
    "\n",
    "Ascent:    67\n",
    "Descent:   45           2 of each day's 9 descents have built-in equilibration stops that extend their duration\n",
    "Rest:      45\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Data are acquired by the basic instruments / sensors on a continuous basis. This means that \n",
    "data acquired by insruments on the platform could be compared with those of the profiler when\n",
    "they are co-located, i.e. when the profiler is at rest. This is covered in notebook **Ocean 01 G**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As the profiler\n",
    "disturbs the water it is passing through: Data acquired during ascent are considered more pristine, \n",
    "or representative of the true state of the water. A comparison of ascent to descent is the subject\n",
    "of notebook **Ocean 01 F**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The table below indicates what data are available from the profiler and platform. Pressure,\n",
    "density, salinity, temperature and depth are interrelated. In subsequent notebooks pressure \n",
    "is often used as a proxy for depth; which is generally charted on the vertical axis. This \n",
    "in effect treats the time of a profile as an \"instantaneous\" snapshot of the state of the \n",
    "upper water column. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Temporary fixed width font section should be replaced with a table\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
