    "built to work with this file format, specifically via the `Dataset` and \n",
    "the `DataArray` structures. These in turn inherit from the `pandas` `DataFrame` and `Series`; which in turn\n",
    "are built on the `numpy` n-dimensional array `ndarray`. All of this requires considerable time to \n",

    "    \n",
    "- Read through this notebook without too much concern for detail (suited to a focus on \n",
    "    the data, not on learning to build new workflows).\n",
    "- Work methodically through Jake VanDerplas' excellent (free, online) book \n",
    "    [_The Python Data Science Handbook_ (herein abbreviated **PDSH**)](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) \n",

    "and no wavelength channel. \n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "I kept the pressure bins the same even though the nitrate averates about 3 three samples or less per minute\n",
    "during a 70 minute ascent. That's about three meters per minute so one sample per meter. Since the \n",
    "spectrophotometer bin depth is 0.25 meters there are necessarily a lot of empty bins (bins with no data)\n",
    "for the nitrate profile. \n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Two open issues\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A curious artifact of the situation is from a past bias: I had understood that the SCIP makes pauses \n",
    "on descent to accommodate the nitrate sensor. I may be in error but now it looks like this sensor, \n",

    "why the pauses occur on the descent. If I have that right. \n",
    "\n",

    "Finally there are two nitrate signals: 'samp' and 'dark'. This code addresses only 'samp' as 'dark'\n",
