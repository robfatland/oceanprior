## Topics of this Repo
    
- The centerpiece BioOptics notebook
    - Defers utility code to the supporting BioOpticsModule.py file
    - Decomposition of pressure/time to infer **profile timing metadata**
    - Daily profile chart illustrating nine profiles including noon/midnight variants
    - **Depth** vs { **Temp, Dissolved Oxygen, Salinity, Chlor-A, FDOM (CDOM), backscatter** }
    - (placeholder) Depth vs pCO2: midnight/noon descent
    - **Depth vs pH**: midnight/noon descent
    - **Depth vs { Spectral Irradiance }**: midnight/noon ascent 
    - **Depth vs PAR (continuous) and nitrate** (midnight/noon ascent)
    - **Depth vs current** including turbulence
    - Comparison: **Shallow profiler versus discrete CTD cast data from cruises**
- Notebooks sub-folder
    - Ocean 01 A: Parent of BioOptics: Slated to be subsumed / deleted
    - Ocean 01 B/C/D/E/F: Likewise: Development code and docs, to be subsumed / deleted
    - Ocean 01 G: Compares ascent data to descent data from continuous sensors
    - Ocean 01 H: Compares Science Pod at rest on platform with platform sensors
    - Ocean 01 K: Further background on bio-optical sensors (no spectrophotometer)
    - Ocean 01 L: Initial attempts at differentiation with respect to depth
    - Ocean 01 M: **Spectrophotometer**: Disabled pending source data refresh
    - Ocean 02: Sea Surface = **MODIS Aqua surface chlorophyll**, broken pending refresh
    - Ocean 03 **ARGO**: ARGO compared with RCA (nbk broken pending source data refresh) 
    - Ocean 04 Global Ocean: Depth-wise global explorer for GLODAP temp/salinity/DO (refresh needed)
    - Ocean 05 A **Sea Floor Axial Inflation**: Tilt and pressure data at ASHES vent field
    - Ocean 05 B Sea Floor Background: Backing resources / documentation for 05 A above
    - Ocean 06 Science: Notes on global carbon cycle
    - Ocean 07 Data Acquisition: Notes on getting datasets (refresh needed) 
    - Ocean 08 **Programming Resources**: Fairly careful notes on methods used in the above notebooks
